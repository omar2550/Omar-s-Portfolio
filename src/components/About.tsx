          I&apos;m Omar Hassein, a second-year Computer Science student at Ain
          Shams University. <br />
          I&apos;m a front-end developer passionate about building interactive
          and visually appealing web applications. I enjoy learning new
          technologies and continuously improving my skills in React, Next.js,
          TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Recently, Iâ€™ve also explored libraries
          like Three.js and Framer Motion to create more dynamic user
          experiences. My goal is to design user-friendly interfaces and
          contribute to impactful projects as I grow in my development journey.
